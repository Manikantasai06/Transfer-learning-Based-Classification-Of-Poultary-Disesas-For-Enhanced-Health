## 📌 Project Overview

Poultry farming plays a significant role in the agricultural sector. However, disease outbreaks can result in major losses. This project implements a deep learning model using **pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** like VGG16, ResNet50, and MobileNet to detect diseases in poultry from images with high accuracy.
