# 🐔 Transfer Learning-Based Classification of Poultry Disease for Enhanced Health

This project leverages **transfer learning** techniques to accurately classify poultry diseases using image data, aiming to enhance animal health management, reduce economic losses, and assist farmers and veterinarians with early disease detection.


##📊 Dataset

Source: Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chandrashekarnatesh/poultry-diseases

Contains labeled images of various pollen species.



## 📌 Project Overview

Poultry farming plays a significant role in the agricultural sector. However, disease outbreaks can result in major losses. This project implements a deep learning model using **pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** like VGG16, ResNet50, and MobileNet to detect diseases in poultry from images with high accuracy.

### 🔬 Key Features

- 🧠 Transfer learning with fine-tuned CNN architectures
- 🐓 Focused on poultry diseases (e.g., Newcastle, Fowl Pox, Coccidiosis)
- 📸 Dataset preprocessing and augmentation for robust learning
- 📈 Achieved ~90% accuracy
- 📊 Real-time prediction support
